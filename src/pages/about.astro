          The CUNY AI Lab is a faculty and staff-led incubator for experimentation with AI by CUNY researchers across disciplines,
          strengthening CUNY's position at the leading edge of technological innovation. Located at the CUNY Graduate Center and
          led by experienced scholars and technologists who have built widely used open publishing platforms, the Lab fosters momentum
          for AI experimentation while foregrounding ethical practices and values that reinforce CUNY's mission.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          This initiative responds to the urgency surrounding LLM adoption in higher education by offering domain-specific tools
          developed with a focus on privacy, sustainability, transparency, and criticality. It builds on recent work such as the
          Google.org-sponsored Critical AI Literacy Institute (CALI), as well as initiatives such as the CUNY Academic Commons
          (50,000+ members) and Manifold Scholarship (adopted by dozens of academic publishers), which underscore the Graduate Center's
          longstanding commitment to creating accessible, scalable, and institutionally supported digital infrastructure for use across CUNY.

  <!-- The Challenge -->

    <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">The Challenge</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        The rapid integration of AI into higher education has created both opportunity and anxiety. Faculty express growing concern
        about losing control over pedagogical and research processes as AI becomes increasingly integrated into software applications
        and learning systems. The CUNY AI Lab grounds its work in a set of practices and technical affordances that help open the
        "black box" of AI tools.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Through the implementation of these principles, we work to center faculty and student agency in the development and deployment
        of open AI tools, offering them increased control over how AI may enter their classrooms and research. This intervention will
        also foster the development of approaches to generative AI that emphasize environmental- and data-consciousness among end users
        of university technologies.

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Our goal is to provide CUNY faculty and students with reliable access to AI models through zero-retention API services,
        accessed through a dedicated OpenWebUI instance. This approach is more cost-effective than local hardware and has been
        successfully implemented at institutions like Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz and Cornell University.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">OpenWebUI Platform</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          OpenWebUI is an open-source, modular platform that offers a unified interface layer between users and AI models.
          It's model-agnostic, maintaining robust support for model evaluation and customization, enabling faculty to package
          entire AI configurations as shareable, citable academic tools.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        We maintain a curated model registry that prioritizes open-weight, auditable models mapped to specific instructional and
        research tasks. The platform displays per-run energy/COâ‚‚e estimates and supports accessibility features including text-to-speech,
        speech-to-text, and upcoming screen-reader compatibility.
