        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          The CUNY AI Lab is a faculty and staff-led initiative for experimentation with AI by CUNY researchers across disciplines.
          Located at the CUNY Graduate Center and led by experienced scholars and technologists who have built widely used open
          publishing platforms, the Lab supports AI experimentation while prioritizing ethical practices and values that reinforce
          CUNY's mission.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          This initiative addresses the rapid adoption of AI in higher education by offering tools developed with a focus on
          privacy, sustainability, transparency, and critical thinking. It builds on recent work such as the Google.org-sponsored
          Critical AI Literacy Institute (CALI), as well as initiatives like the CUNY Academic Commons (50,000+ members) and
          Manifold Scholarship (adopted by dozens of academic publishers), which reflect the Graduate Center's longstanding
          commitment to creating accessible, scalable digital infrastructure for use across CUNY.

  <!-- The Challenge -->

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold font-display text-neutral-stone mb-6">The Challenge</h2>
      <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl shadow-sm border border-gray-100">
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          The rapid integration of AI into higher education has created both opportunity and anxiety. Faculty express growing concern
          about losing control over pedagogical and research processes as AI becomes increasingly integrated into software applications
          and learning systems. The CUNY AI Lab uses transparent practices and open tools to help demystify how AI systems work.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          Through these principles, we put faculty and students in control of how AI tools are developed and used in their classrooms
          and research. We also promote awareness of the environmental and data privacy implications of AI use.

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
        Our goal is to provide CUNY faculty and students with reliable access to AI models through zero-retention API services,
        accessed through a dedicated OpenWebUI instance. This approach is more cost-effective than local hardware and has been
        successfully implemented at institutions like Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz and Cornell University.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-vibrant-900 mb-3">OpenWebUI Platform</h3>
        <p class="text-vibrant-800 leading-relaxed">
          OpenWebUI is an open-source, modular platform that offers a unified interface layer between users and AI models.
          It's model-agnostic, maintaining robust support for model evaluation and customization, enabling faculty to package
          entire AI configurations as shareable, citable academic tools.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        We maintain a collection of open-weight, auditable AI models suited to specific teaching and research tasks. The platform
        displays energy and CO₂ estimates for each use and supports accessibility features including text-to-speech, speech-to-text,
        and upcoming screen-reader compatibility.
