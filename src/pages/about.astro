          The CUNY AI Lab (CAIL) is a faculty- and staff-led initiative for experimentation with AI by CUNY researchers across disciplines. Based at the CUNY Graduate Center, the Lab supports work with AI that prioritizes ethical practice and aligns with CUNY's public mission.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          Funded by the CUNY Office of Academic Affairs, CAIL responds to the rapid adoption of AI in higher education by building infrastructure designed around real campus needs. The Lab's work is organized around experimentation and aims to produce purpose-driven projects developed in response to concrete research and teaching questions. Our goal is to deconstruct the discourse around Generative AI as a single, abstract technology, in favor of building a form of literacy that emphasizes user agency and treats AI as a set of techniques that can be prototyped, evaluated, and revised, allowing faculty, staff, and students to be in control of the tools they use.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          CAIL draws on recent work such as the Google.org-sponsored Critical AI Literacy Institute (CALI), as well as initiatives like the <a href="https://commons.gc.cuny.edu/" class="text-vibrant-600 hover:text-vibrant-700 underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CUNY Academic Commons</a> and <a href="https://manifoldapp.org/" class="text-vibrant-600 hover:text-vibrant-700 underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manifold Scholarship</a>, which reflect CUNY's longstanding commitment to creating accessible, scalable digital infrastructure. Building on these efforts, we are piloting CAIL in a select number of courses across CUNY and working toward broader access over time. As we scale, we are committed to developing infrastructure grounded in privacy, sustainability, transparency, and critical thinking—and to providing CUNY faculty, staff, and students with reliable access to AI tools that make retention policies, model selection, and evaluation practices explicit.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          CAIL is jointly administered by Graduate Center Digital Initiatives (GCDI), the Teaching and Learning Center (TLC), the Mina Rees Library, and the American Social History Project / Center for Media and Learning (ASHP/CML). <a href={`${base}team`} class="text-vibrant-600 hover:text-vibrant-700 underline">Learn more about our team</a>.
